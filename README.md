# Who Call

A tiny npm command that search comments from some sources (ex.: http://ligaram-me.com) based on a given phone number from Portugal.

## How does it works?

Simply run `npm i -g who-call` to install globally, then if you want to search for a phone number run `who-call <phone-number>` üëç

Or you can run `npx who-call <phone-number>` without installing anything.

Have fun!
